<h2 id="appendix1">Appendix I - Ubuntu</h2>


To install OpenStack on Ubuntu vm, the steps are the same as on CentOS, besides:

* Looking for Ubuntu MAC address in VMware vSphere.
* In the Serves section, please select *Ubuntu-12.04-x86_64/openstack* as your adapter.
* In the Hosts section, make sure enter a different host name for Ubuntu so it will not cause conflict.


Other process instruction please follow CentOS instruction above.
