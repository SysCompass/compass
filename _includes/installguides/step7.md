<h2 id="step-seven">Step 7 - Partition</h2>


This step helps you do the partition. Compass provides LVM partitions. You can add/remove mount points during this step. /root mount point's existence is mandatory and please keep in mind that although other mount points are optional, most operating systems require  **/usr** and **/var**. So having **/usr** and **/var** in your partition is strongly recommended. You can give each mount point a specific percentage, and its maximum size. Once you have finished, click "Next" to proceed.
