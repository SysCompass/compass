We provide a pre-configured Compass VM image for you to get a detailed look at what Compass can do. It is packaged as a VirtualBox appliance in OVF(Open Virtualization Format). We provide a Windows batch file to import the appliance and setup the Compass demo environment in VirtualBox. Currently, it only supports Windows.
