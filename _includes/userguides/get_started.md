<h2 id="started">Getting Started</h2>

We provide a pre-configured Compass VM image for you to get a detailed look at what Compass can do. It is packaged as a VirtualBox appliance in OVF. We support MacOS/Ubuntu/Windows at this time. We provide shell/bash scripts to import Compass server and step networks as well as a slave machine.

System requirements are:

   * CPU Architecture: x86_64

   * OSX(tested on Mavericks)/Windows 7 (64-bit)/Ubuntu(tested on 14.04)

   * VirtualBox: VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware provided by Oracle. VirtualBox can be downloaded from its official web site at [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

   * VirtualBox Extension Pack, which is also available from [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

 		* We have successfully tested this Compass Appliance on both `Oracle VirtualBox 4.3.4 and 4.3.6`

When you start the VirtualBox, it should look like this:

***NOTE: if the VirtualBox on your system has pre-existing Compass-related VMs and networks, you may need to clean up before you follow these steps. *** Please refer to <a href="#appendix1">Appendix-I</a> if you need guide on how to clean up Compass from VirtualBox.
