If you would like to try out Compass again, you need to remove all the VirtualBox hosts and network configurations.

Once you have removed all hosts, remove the host-only interface: File-Preferences. Then click on the “Network” tab then the “Host-only Networks” tab to remove.

You will need local admin privilege to perform the removal of network adapters.

At this point, your Compass environment has been removed and you can start over by executing runme.bat again.
