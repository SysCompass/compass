<h2 id="step-one">Step 1 - Run Script</h2>

Once you have downloaded the Compass Golden Image zip file, extract it and execute the ”runme.bat” file. During the execution, the batch file will ask you for administrator’s permission to apply changes to VirtualBox. The execution may take up to 5 minutes as it copies the VDI image to your VirtualBox VMs directory. Two virtual machines will be created by the batch script for OpenStack installation demo purposes.
