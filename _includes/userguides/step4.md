A window will pop up when you click on "New Cluster" button. It is asking you for basic information about your cluster. Compass Appliance only supports OpenStack Icehouse on CentOS-6.5 Operating System. Therefore we have already pre-filled the values for you. You may always customize the cluster name.

You won't be able to see any servers as this is a brand new Compass environment. To discover servers, click on the "Discover Servers" button on the top-right.
