<h2 id="step-six">Step 6 - Global Configuration</h2>

In this step, you are setting up the global configuration of the server(s) you are going to install OpenStack on. All the required field(except confirm password) have been pre-filled. Most of these values should not be changed unless you change the Compass server's configuration. For the password field, the default password is 'huawei'. You may type 'huawei' in the password confirm field or override the default password with your own password.
