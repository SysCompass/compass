The security page enables the customizing of server and service credentials. As you can see in the security page screenshot, there are three sets of credentials you need to setup. 

**OpenStack Server Credentials: **

--- The combination of username and password for Linux operating system on each server

**OpenStack Service Credentials: **

--- The combination of username and password for all the services running within the target distribution system


**OpenStack Management Console Credentials: **

--- The combination of username and password for OpenStack Dashboard Web-UI authentication

Compass golden image provides pre-configured credentials. As you can see from the screenshot above, usernames are configured already. Passwords and their respective usernames are identical. (e.g: OpenStack server credential: Username: root, password: root)
