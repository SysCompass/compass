<h2 id="step-nine">Step 9 - Target System Configuration</h2>

You are configuring target system on this page. For OpenStack, the configuration is mainly about credentials, including component credentials and keystone user credentials. We have pre-filled these credential values for you. So you can proceed just by clicking on "Next". You can change some or all of the credentials and you will get a chance to review them on the review page before deployment.
