<h2 id="step-eight">Step 8 - Hosts</h2>

Hosts, although different from servers, are essentially instantiated server objects with "policies" such as networking configuration and security configuration attached to them. Therefore a host is a representative of a well-deployed machine in the data center after Compass has done all its jobs. In the Host Configuration page, you may specify a hostname for each host. You may find it a pain in the butt if you are deploying a large scale cluster. Great news, Compass UI can help! Simply allow it to batch-assign hostnames for you with different kinds of patterns you may choose from.
