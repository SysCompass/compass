Apache2 is supported. mod_wsgi is required to run Compass web app. 

On Ubuntu systems (e.g, 12.04), you can install mod_wsgi with
  sudo aptitude install libapache2-mod-wsgi

The current wsgi config file assumes that the environment variable
ODS_PROJECT_HOME is set in /etc/apache2/envvars file.You also need
to make sure mod_rewrite module in apache is enabled. If not, you
need to run the command: sudo a2enmod rewrite

We also assume that the server host name is ods-server.us.huawei.com.

Restart Apache to get mod_wsgi to work.

sudo service apache2 restart
